                <h5>MEET BARB HARRISON</h5>
                <p>Barb Harrison has lived in Athens, Ohio for more than 30 years. She originally found her way to
                    Athens for school in the 1980s. After graduating from Ohio University and leaving Athens in 1987,
                    Harrison realized she was missing a deep spiritual connection that only nature could satisfy. She
                    moved back to the area in 1991 to take a job at her alma mater. This move helped her meet people who
                    introduced her to both Paganism and Unitarian Universalism. Today, she serves as the president of
                    the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens (UUFA).</p>
                <p>“This is where I find my spiritual home,” Harrison says.</p>

            <!----- About Her Practice Text ----->
            <h5>ABOUT HER PRACTICE</h5>
            <p>Harrison’s lifelong connection to nature led her to Paganism.</p>
            <p>“I grew up on a farm, and so I was taught from a very young age to really respect the natural world and
                how we are connected to it,” Harrison says. The older she grew, the more important that connection was
                to her.</p>
            <p>As a young adult, Harrison never practiced any faith routinely. She was raised Methodist and married a
                Jewish man whom she later divorced, but never felt it was necessary to devote herself to any one
                religion.</p>
            <p>After having a child, Harrison wondered what she would tell her son about her spirituality. This forced
                her to reflect on her own beliefs instead of blindly participating in the practices of those close to
                her. For a long time, Harrison had been curious about Paganism and Unitarian Universalism, so she
                decided to attend a service at the UUFA.</p>
            <p>“The rest is history, I guess,” Harrison says. She now practices both Paganism and Unitarian
                Universalism.</p>

                <h5>WHERE SHE PRACTICES: THE UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST FELLOWSHIP OF ATHENS (UUFA)</h5>
                <p>The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens is a building intended for the practice of Unitarian
                    Universalism, but welcomes anyone practicing any religion. It is part of a larger denomination
                    called the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). The UUA sprouted from two Christian
                    denominations: Unitarianism and Universalism. For many years, both denominations maintained separate
                    spaces in the United States, but they eventually merged in the 1960s. Although Unitarian
                    Universalism has changed drastically over time, it has always remained very committed to social
                    justice and inclusion.</p>
                <p>It is possible to find any number of faiths within a Unitarian Universalist congregation. At the
                    UUFA, Earth-centered faiths like Paganism are common. Some members even identify as agnostic or
                    atheist. Most members live nearby, but some live more than 30 miles away and still make the weekly
                    trip to attend service every Sunday.</p>
                <p>Harrison also likes to practice at her home. She lives a short way from the UUFA on a stretch of land
                    that features a serene wooded area where she likes to practice her faith. Indoors, Harrison has set
                    up a shrine where she can worship if the weather is poor. “The kind of cool thing about Paganism is
                    that I feel I can practice it anywhere,” she says. “I think for me, that's the freeing part… it's
                    not required that you have a clergy person or any kind of other intermediaries, so to speak, between
                    you and the higher powers.”

                Universalism has seven principles that guide how members live their lives and practice their faith.</p>

                <p>The UUFA begins its weekly Sunday morning service by lighting a chalice and welcoming its members to
                    a safe and inclusive environment. During the service, members have the opportunity to come up to a
                    podium to share their joys and concerns to the community.</p>
                <p>“That’s how we sort of connect with each other,” Harrison says. “If there’s someone that's having a
                    really hard time, they can put it out there and others can send them well wishes and be with them.”
                    The UUFA hopes to provide people with a place to make connections.</p>

                <p>Unitarian Universalist congregations are self-governing and elect their own leaders. Each has the

                    how they want to grow. For Harrison, the UUFA gives her a chance to step back from her work life and
                    focus on her spirituality.</p>

    <!----- Keep Faith Private Text ----->
    <section class="container">
        <div class="section-text">
            <h5>KEEPING FAITH PRIVATE</h5>

            <p>Although she finds freedom in her faith, Harrison keeps her spiritual life private.</p>
            <p>“I really pick and choose who I feel comfortable telling,” Harrison says, adding that she does not talk
                about it at work for fear someone might misunderstand her intentions. She has lived in the area long
                enough to know who she can and cannot speak to about expressing her faith, so she finds herself mainly
                confiding in other Pagan community members.</p>

            <p>“[In Athens], we are sort of a bubble and a microcosm and we do enjoy a lot of things that other
                communities wouldn’t, but I think for the most part, [Paganism and Unitarian Universalism are] pretty
                accepted,” Harrison says.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, not every community where Unitarian Universalist churches reside are as lucky or as safe.
            </p>

            <p>In 2008, a man targeted a Unitarian Universalist Church in Tennessee because he believed the church
                represented anti-American sentiments. The police affidavit reports the shooter saying he made his attack
                because he disagreed with the “liberal teachings” of the church. Two people died and six people were
                injured in the shooting.</p>
            <p>“We feel pretty fortunate that we're in a community where we’re respected, but there's definitely a risk
                with that just because of our current society,” Harrison says.</p>
