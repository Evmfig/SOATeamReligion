                <h5>MEET BARB HARRISON</h5>
                <p>Barb Harrison has lived in Athens, Ohio for over 30 years. A native Ohioan, Harrison grew up
                    practicing Methodism and found her way to Athens for school in the 1980s. After years away from
                    Athens, Harrison realized she needed a connection with nature in order to be spiritually happy. She
                    moved back to the area in 1991 to take a job at Ohio University. This move helped her discover both
                    Paganism and Unitarian Universalism, and she currently practices both faiths. She serves as the
                    president of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens (UUFA). </p>
                <p>“This is where I find my spiritual home,” Harrison says.</p>

            <!----- About Her Practice Text ----->
            <h5>ABOUT HER PRACTICE</h5>
            <p>Harrison practices Paganism because it has always been a part of her life.</p>
            <p>“I grew up on a farm, and so I was taught from a very young age to really respect the natural world and
                how we are part of it and how we are connected to it,” Harrison says. The older she grew, the more
                important she realized that connection was to her.</p>
            <p>As a young adult, Harrison never practiced any faith routinely. She was raised Methodist and married a
                Jewish man, but still never saw it necessary to devote herself to any one religion. After having a
                child, Harrison began wondering what she would tell her son she believed in spiritually.
                She was forced to ask herself what she wanted to practice, instead of accepting what she was told to
                practice. After a while, she separated from her husband. For a long time, Harrison had been curious
                about the Unitarian Universalists, and decided to attend a service. </p>
            <p>“The rest is history, I guess,” Harrison says.</p>

                <h5>WHERE SHE PRACTICES: THE UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST FELLOWSHIP OF ATHENS (UUFA)</h5>
                <p>The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens is part of a larger denomination called the Unitarian
                    Universalist Association (UUA) that sprouted from two Christian denominations: the Unitarians and
                    the Universalists. For many years, both denominations maintained separate spaces in the United
                    States, but merged in the 1960s. Unitarian Universalism has changed drastically over time, but
                    remains a faith community very committed to social justice.</p>
                <p>It’s possible to find any number of faiths within a Unitarian Universalist congregation. At the UUFA,
                    Earth-centered faiths, like Paganism, are common. Some identify as Agnostic or Atheist. Most members
                    live nearby, but some live over thirty miles away, and make the weekly trip to attend service every
                    Sunday.</p>

            <h4>The Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalists</h4>
            <p>Unitarian Universalism has seven guiding principles that direct how Unitarian Universalists live their
                lives and practice their faith.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The inherent worth and dignity of every being;</li>
                <li>Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;</li>
                <li>Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;</li>
                <li>A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;</li>
                <li>The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in
                    society at large;</li>
                <li>The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;</li>
                <li>Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.</li>

    <!----- Strength In Community Text ----->

                <h5>Strength in Community</h5>
                <p>The UUFA hosts a weekly service every Sunday morning, where members come together to create a
                    welcoming environment. They light a challis and in every service devote time to allowing members to
                    come up to a podium to briefly talk about a joy or concern that may be weighing on them.</p>
                <p>“That’s how we sort of connect with each other,” Harrison says. “If there’s someone that's having a
                    really hard time, they can put it out there and others can send them well wishes and be with them.”
                    The UUFA hopes to provide people with a place to make connections.</p>

                <p>“We know that many folks who come do have other faith paths that they may have explored, but here we
                    recognize that that is kind of a private journey for a lot of people and so we respect that,”
                    Harrison says, “We don't ask people to sign-on to a particular creed.” </p>
                <p>The UUA is self-governing and elects its own leaders. The congregations decide how to present
                    themselves individually, what they want to learn and how they want to grow. A lot of power and
                    decision-making is given to the congregations. For Harrison, the UUFA gives her a chance to separate
                    her work from her faith.</p>

        <!----- Keep Faith Private Text ----->
        <div class="section-text">
            <p>Although she finds freedom in her faith, Harrison keeps her spiritual life private.</p>
            <p>“I really pick and choose who I feel comfortable telling,” Harrison says. She doesn’t talk about it at
                work for fear someone might misunderstand her intentions. She has lived in the area long enough to know
                who she can and can’t speak to about expressing her faith, mainly taking refuge in other Pagan community
                members.</p>
            <p>“We feel pretty fortunate that we're in a community where we’re respected, but there's definitely a risk
                with that, you know, just because of our current society,” Harrison says.</p>
            <p>“It’s really hard in Athens, because I know that we are sort of a bubble and a microcosm and we do enjoy
                a lot of things that other communities wouldn’t, but I think for the most part, [Paganism and Unitarian
                Universalism are] pretty accepted,” Harrison says. </p>
