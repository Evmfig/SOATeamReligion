            <h5>MEET BARB HARRISON</h5>
            <p>Barb Harrison has lived in Athens, Ohio for over 30 years. A native Ohioan, Harrison grew up practicing
                Methodism and found her way to Athens for school in the 1980s. After years away from Athens, Harrison
                realized she needed a connection with nature in order to be spiritually happy. Moving back to the area
                helped her discover both Paganism and Unitarian Universalism, and she currently practices both faiths.
                She serves as the president of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens (UUFA).</p>
            <p>“This is where I find my spiritual home,” Harrison says.</p>

    <!----- About Her Practice Text ----->
    <section>
        <div class="section-text">
            <h5>ABOUT HER PRACTICE</h5>
            <p>Harrison practices Paganism because it has always been a part of her life.</p>
            <p>“I grew up on a farm, and so I was taught from a very young age to really respect the natural world and
                how
                we are part of it and how we are connected to it,” Harrison says. The older she grew, the more important
                she
                realized that connection was to her.</p>
            <p>After attending Ohio University in the ’80s, Harrison lived in other places where she didn't have easy
                access to the natural world. Realizing she needed to be in a place that allowed her to have a connection
                to
                nature, she eventually found her way back to Athens, Ohio in 1991 to work for the university. Once she
                joined the UUFA in 2001, she started learning more about what others like her were practicing: Paganism.
            </p>
            <p>As a young adult, Harrison never practiced any faith routinely. She was raised Methodist and married a
                Jewish man, but still never saw it necessary to devote herself to any one religion.</p>
            <p>After having a child, Harrison began wondering what she would tell her son she believed in spiritually.
                She
                was forced to ask herself what she wanted to practice, instead of accepting what she was told to
                practice.
                After awhile, she separated from her husband. For a long time, Harrison had been curious about the
                Unitarian
                Universalists, and decided to attend a service. She has remained there ever since.</p>
            <p>Harrison’s family was involved heavily at the Methodist church they attended. Having grown up with a
                sense
                of community, safety, and connection, Harrison found those same themes within the UUFA.</p>
            <p>“I felt like this community was one that really resonated for me and had a lot of those characteristics
                that
                I had grown up with,” Harrison says. She got involved quickly and started to learn more about the
                different
                religious denominations that people brought to the congregation, eventually learning about others who
                practiced Earth-centered faiths, such as Paganism.</p>
            <p>“The rest is history, I guess,” Harrison says.</p>
            <p>Although she finds freedom in her faith, Harrison keeps her spiritual life private.</p>
            <p> “I really pick and choose who I feel comfortable telling,” Harrison says. She doesn’t talk about it at
                work
                for fear someone might misunderstand her intentions. She has lived in the area long enough to know who
                she
                can and can’t speak to about expressing her faith, mainly taking refuge in other Pagan community
                members.
            </p>
            <p>“We feel pretty fortunate that we're in a community where we’re respected, but there's definitely a risk
                with that, you know, just because of our current society,” Harrison says.</p>
            <p>“It’s really hard in Athens, because I know that we are sort of a bubble and a microcosm and we do enjoy
                a
                lot of things that other communities wouldn’t, but I think for the most part, [Paganism and Unitarian
                Universalism are] pretty accepted,” Harrison says.</p>

        <div class="section-text">
            <h5>WHERE SHE PRACTICES: THE UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST FELLOWSHIP OF ATHENS (UUFA)</h5>
            <p>The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens is part of a larger denomination called the Unitarian
                Universalist Association (UUA) that sprouted from two Christian denominations: the Unitarians and the
                Universalists. For many years, both denominations maintained separate spaces in the United States, but
                merged in the 1960s. Unitarian Universalism has changed drastically over time, but remains a faith
                community very committed to social justice.</p>
            <p>It’s possible to find any number of faiths within a Unitarian Universalist congregation. At the UUFA,
                Earth-centered faiths are common, such as Paganism. Some identify as Agnostic or Atheist. Most members
                live
                nearby, but some live over thirty miles away, and make the weekly trip to attend service every Sunday.

            <h4>The Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalists</h4>
            <p>Unitarian Universalism has seven guiding principles that direct how Unitarian Universalists live their
                lives and practice their faith.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The inherent worth and dignity of every being;</li>
                <li>Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;</li>
                <li>Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;</li>
                <li>A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;</li>
                <li>The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in
                    society at large;</li>
                <li>The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;</li>
                <li>Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.</li>

    <!----- Strength In Community Text ----->
    <section>
        <div class="section-text">
            <h5>Strength in Community</h5>
            <p>The UUFA hosts a weekly service every Sunday morning, where members come together to create a welcoming
                environment. They light a challis and in every service devote time to allowing members to come up to a
                podium to briefly talk about a joy or concern that may be weighing on them.</p>
            <p>“That’s how we sort of connect with each other,” Harrison says. “If there’s someone that's having a
                really hard time, they can put it out there and others can send them well wishes and be with them.” The
                UUFA hopes to provide people with a place to make connections.</p>
            <p>“We know that many folks who come do have other faith paths that they may have explored, but here we
                recognize that that is kind of a private journey for a lot of people and so we respect that,” Harrison
                says.</p>

            <p>The UUA is self-governing and elects its own leaders. The congregations decide how to present themselves
                individually, what they want to learn and how they want to grow. A lot of power and decision-making is
                given to the congregations. For Harrison, the UUFA gives her a chance to separate her work from her
                faith.</p>
            <p>“We welcome people who are searching. We often welcome folks that may not feel welcome in other
                congregations,” Harrison says. “We are accepting of all kinds of love.”</p>

            <h5>Fighting for Social Justice</h5>
            <p>Unitarian Universalist congregations are few and far between in the Midwest. For Southeast Ohio, the UUFA
                provides a liberal and progressive voice in the community.</p>
            <p>“We do sort of step up and take a lot of leadership with regard to social justice issues in the
                community,” Harrison says. “If there's a parade in town or a speak-out or a march that has something to
                do with social justice or our principles, we'll be there.”</p>
